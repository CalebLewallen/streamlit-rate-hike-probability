            Every armchair economist takes to Twitter and LinkedIn leading up to each meeting about why their contrarian viewpoint will hold true. Since I'm not \
            as smart as those individuals, I instead have to rely on what the market says about each meeting. To do this, we only need to look as far as a single \
            futures market, and apply some statistical principals.")

         Notice that the further into the future the meeting is, the confidence level decreases. This should intuitively make sense, since we're less and less sure about events into the future, both \
         from a time perspective *and* the fact each meeting's policy decision is influenced by what happens prior. Data comes from the CME Group and was last updated on " + trade_date + ".")
